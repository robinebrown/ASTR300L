'''
1. Write a Python script which computes the gravitational force between (a) the
Earth and the Moon, and (b) The Sun and the Moon (you will need to look
up masses and mean distances). The code should print the result as a number
formatted to two decimal places. This last step involves looking up how to
output formatted numbers in Python.

mass_earth = 5.972 * (10**24)
mass_moon = 7.34767309 * (10**22)
print(mass_moon)
